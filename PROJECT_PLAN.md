# Final Project Plan — BUSN 41210 Financial Analytics, Autumn 2026

Status: **plan only — awaiting your approval. No notebook cell has been written or run.**
Companion document: [`METHODOLOGY_LOG.md`](METHODOLOGY_LOG.md) (the running justification log; every decision below has an entry there with alternatives, assumptions and evidence).

**How to read the citations.** `L5 p.56` = Lecture 5 PDF, page 56 (PDF page = slide). `cell 36` = cell 36 of `Final_Autumn_2026-1.ipynb` (0-based). `AIG §4` = AI Coding Guide section 4. Items tagged **[EXAM-DEFINED]** are required or defined by the exam notebook but not taught in any lecture (VaR, kurtosis, Sharpe ratio, risk parity, TSMOM, transaction costs, the placebo). Items tagged **[OUR CHOICE]** are design decisions with no single lecture source; the log records why. Nothing outside the lectures and the exam's own definitions is used unless it is listed under the open questions at the end.

## 0. Ground rules held throughout (from the AI Coding Guide and L5 p.58–59)

| Rule | Where it bites | How the plan honours it |
|---|---|---|
| **Fatal (a):** no shuffled split or shuffled folds on time-ordered data (AIG §4a; L5 p.58 #3, p.59) | P3 (monthly panel); P1.5 (explained) | P3 uses one hand-written date-mask splitter; every fold asserts `train.max() < validation.min()`. Shuffled folds appear only in P1, where the rows are unrelated people (L8 p.45) — and 1.5 explains why that would be wrong for months. |
| **Fatal (b):** no scaler / imputer / PCA fitted before the split (AIG §4b; L5 p.58 #1, p.47) | P3 | Every scaler is fitted inside each training window or fold only. Cross-sectional ranks are same-date; trailing z-scores and volatilities use past data only. No imputer is used (nothing is filled). |
| (c) `LogisticRegression()` is L2-penalised by default (AIG §4c; L6 p.38) | not used | Not used anywhere. If ever needed: `LogisticRegression(C=np.inf)` — on the installed sklearn 1.9.1, L6 p.38's `penalty=None` raises a FutureWarning (verified). |
| (d) `r2_score` / `.score` benchmark against the test mean (AIG §4d; L5 p.57) | P3 | Own `r2_oos(y, yhat, bench)` against a benchmark fixed before each forecast month (trailing mean) and against zero. `r2_score` and `.score` are never used for R². |
| pandas 3 / sklearn 1.9 traps (AIG §3) | all | `pd.concat` not `append`; `.ffill()` not `fillna(method=)`; `.items()`; no `sns.set()`; scaler in a Pipeline, never `normalize=`. |
| Describe data first; check against something known; verify the headline (AIG §6) | all | Each problem starts with shape/dtypes/counts checked against the data profile; known-answer checks are listed per part. |
| Every number comes from a cell (cell 1) | all | Every number quoted in an answer or the write-up is printed by a cell; a final P3 cell prints all headline numbers. |

**One data-path convention for all three setup cells (cells 4, 21, 35):** keep the exam's server line and add `import os; _DATA_DIR = _DATA_DIR if os.path.isdir(_DATA_DIR) else './'`. The same notebook then runs unchanged on the class server and on a local copy (cell 38).

## Problem 1 — Trees and Ensembles (Social_Network_Ads, 400 people)

All accuracies use the notebook's own `cv5 = StratifiedKFold(5, shuffle=True, random_state=7034)` and `cv_acc()`, so every model is scored on the **same folds** (L8 p.53: "the comparison is only meaningful because the split is shared"). `random_state=7034` on every tree, forest, boosting model, split and permutation. Shuffled folds are legitimate here because rows are unrelated people — a cross-section (L8 p.45). Trees need no scaling, and there are no missing values, so there is no preprocessing that could leak.

| Part | Method | Lecture grounding |
|---|---|---|
| **1.1** Baseline | "Nobody purchases" = majority-class accuracy (257/400 = 64.25% pooled; 63.75–65% fold by fold), stated first as the bar. | Accuracy "with the majority-class rate next to it" L6 p.57; root node [257, 143] L8 p.30/p.33; "compared to what?" L1 p.81 |
| | Unpruned tree: `DecisionTreeClassifier(random_state=7034)` (defaults = grown out), 5-fold CV accuracy; also its leaf count and in-sample accuracy as a labelled over-fitting diagnostic. | Grown-out tree on this very dataset overfits: L8 p.30 (the 400-row tree, ~62 leaves); choose size out of sample L8 p.29, p.32 |
| | Sweep `max_leaf_nodes` ∈ {2,3,4,6,8,12}; choose the best CV accuracy, **exact ties → smaller** (compare integer counts of correct people, not floats). Describe left side (too few leaves → underfit) and right side (more leaves → CV flat/falling while training accuracy rises → fitting noise). Show the 5 per-fold scores and their spread, not a formal test. | `max_leaf_nodes` as the size knob, L8 chose 3: L8 p.33; hump-shaped test accuracy L8 p.32; average fold scores L5 p.28, p.35; parsimony L5 p.25, L4 p.23; the chosen score won a 6-way search so is slightly optimistic L4 p.43, L5 p.57 |
| **1.2** Plot & explain | Refit the chosen size on **all 400 rows** (CV chose a size, not a tree), `plot_tree(..., feature_names=Xa.columns)`, plus `export_text` and an Age × Salary region plot. Answer in **exactly one or two plain sentences** (no "node", "gini"), e.g. "mostly buy / mostly don't buy" with each group's purchase rate; any technical note is kept outside those sentences. | Refit on all data at the chosen tuning value L5 p.36, as L8 p.33 does; reading `plot_tree` L8 p.25, p.33; leaf probability = class share L8 p.17; the data-plane picture L8 p.34 |
| **1.3** RF & GB | `RandomForestClassifier(n_estimators=300, random_state=7034)`, `GradientBoostingClassifier(n_estimators=100, random_state=7034)`, same `cv5`. Report either way, with fold spread. Explanation in 2–3 sentences, **split correctly**: a forest averages away *variance*; boosting adds shallow trees to remove *bias* (L8 p.51 — "Bagging and boosting are opposites"). With 400 people (1 person = 1.25 pp per fold) and a boundary that is close to one rectangle in Age × Salary, a small tree has little of either left to remove, and GB runs untuned (ν = 0.1, depth 3, 100 rounds). | RF = bootstrap + column subsampling, deep trees L8 p.41–45 (√p per split, p.43; B is a budget, p.45); boosting = shrunk residual fitting, ν and B are tuning parameters L8 p.50–52; out-of-the-box boosting lost to the forest L8 p.54–55 |
| **1.4** MDI vs permutation | `train_test_split(Xa, ya, test_size=0.3, random_state=7034, stratify=ya)`; RF(300) on the 70%; `feature_importances_` (in-sample MDI) vs `permutation_importance(rf, X_te, y_te, scoring='accuracy', n_repeats=50, random_state=7034)` on the held-out 30%; side-by-side table + bar chart; split counts per feature and distinct values per feature as evidence for the explanation. Recommend the **held-out permutation ranking** for a decision maker, with caveats (noisy on 120 people; no sign; not causal). | MDI is in-sample L8 p.47, p.56; permutation on held-out data, repeated and averaged, "answers the question you actually asked" L8 p.57; MDI rewards columns with many split points and splits credit across correlated columns L8 p.58; importance has no sign L8 p.60 |
| **1.5** Time-series CV (text) | Rows as months of one stock: shuffled folds train on the future (look-ahead) and put near-identical neighbouring months on both sides of the split; the CV then under-regularises and the reported accuracy is **biased upward** (optimistic). Fix: expanding (or rolling) walk-forward — train → validation → test in time order, hyper-parameters on validation only, test touched once, predictors lagged to t−1, any preprocessing refit inside each training window, benchmark = the "always up/down" rule learned from training months. | Order must be respected L5 p.27; "CV is not valid with time-series data" L5 p.48; expanding scheme L5 p.49–52; "the random fold sees the future … under-regularizes", −0.036 R² L5 p.56; fatal L5 p.58 #3, p.59; split by date "as it would be if the model were put to use" L6 p.30; L1 p.82 |

Non-CV accuracies (in-sample, training folds, the 1.4 held-out 30%) are always labelled **diagnostic**, because cell 3 says every *reported* accuracy is 5-fold CV.

## Problem 2 — Training on Your Own Output (VaR pipeline)

> **Commit-before-compute.** Part 2.1 is your own prediction, written *before* any Problem 2 code runs (L2 p.78: "Write down a number"; L4 p.26). This plan deliberately contains **no expected results** for Problem 2, and the theory notes are withheld from the log until 2.1 is written.

| Part | Method | Lecture grounding |
|---|---|---|
| **Setup** | `SEED` = last four digits of your student ID (written without a leading zero). One `np.random.SeedSequence(SEED)` spawns named independent streams (one desk; 1,000 desks; each 2.3 experiment; 2.4a; 2.4b), so every cell is reproducible on re-run. Night indexing: night 1 fits the real library (sample variance exactly 1); nights 2…2,500 each fit the previous night's 500 scenarios → 2,499 random draw-and-refit steps. | Unbiased s² with ddof = 1 L2 p.56–57; VaR = 2.326 σ̂ **[EXAM-DEFINED]** cell 20 |
| **2.1** | You write 2–3 sentences in cell 23 before any code; it is never edited afterwards and 2.3 quotes it. | L2 p.78; L4 p.26 |
| **2.2** | One desk exactly as the manual (fit `var(ddof=1)`, draw 500 from N(0, σ̂²) — scale = σ̂, not σ̂² — replace, report). Plot log σ̂² vs night; report σ̂² and VaR on night 2,500. Then 1,000 desks vectorised (one 1000 × 500 matrix per night, ≈ 35 s for 2,500 nights); night-2,500 mean, median, 5th/95th percentiles, max of σ̂²; fraction with VaR < truth/10 (with its Monte-Carlo SE as the sample SD of the 0/1 indicator / √1000); percentile rank of the one desk; where the story's 2.8% → 0.24% sits. A unit test checks the literal loop equals the vectorised version. | Monte-Carlo sampling distributions from a known truth L2 p.59–70, p.78–79, L4 p.26–27; log scale for multiplicative change L3 p.48–49; SE of a mean L2 p.63 |
| **2.3** | (i) Martingale check: 200,000 desks from the same σ̂²ₜ (two starting values), one step, average; report mean ratio with a 95% CI and say whether it contains 1 (reporting rule fixed in advance; non-rejection is "consistent with", not "equals"). (ii) Average nightly change in log σ̂² for n = 50, 500, 5,000 (500 desks × 500 nights each, SEs computed), and propose the formula relating it to n from the measurements. (iii) Histogram of log σ̂² across the 1,000 desks on night 2,500. (iv) Reconciliation table: expectation, median, 1,000-desk mean, share of the sum held by the ten largest desks; one paragraph; reconcile with your 2.1. Any theory beyond the lectures is a clearly labelled supplementary note, with any number it quotes computed in a cell. | Unbiasedness L2 p.56; CI / t for a mean L2 p.81, p.84–86; unbiased ≠ precise L2 p.71–72; CLT L2 p.63–64; logs L3 p.48–49 |
| **2.4(a)** | Each desk gets its own 500 real days = N(0,1) draws rescaled to sample variance exactly 1 (not demeaned — the smallest change that meets the rule). Library = those 500 real + tonight's 500 scenarios (1,000; last night's scenarios are replaced). Night-2,500 median, 5th/95th percentiles across 1,000 desks, side by side with 2.2; bands over nights on one plot. | same simulation design; degrees of freedom as information L2 p.57 |
| **2.4(b)** | `dj30.csv`: `groupby('date').MrkRet.first()` → 1,511 days. Daily sample volatility (`std(ddof=1)`) and excess kurtosis (`scipy.stats.kurtosis`, the exam's import, defaults `fisher=True, bias=True` — stated). Night-1 library = **all 1,511 real days** (this reproduces the story's 2.8% VaR). Compare empirical 1% VaR (−first percentile, `np.percentile` linear, stated) with 2.326 σ̂; kurtosis of real returns vs the 500 night-1 scenarios, with a reference band from 10,000 simulated normal samples of 500. Time-series plot of the real returns with both VaR lines. Then the paragraph (contains / lacks; loss of information vs accumulation of noise; implication for self-retrained pipelines; what stops it). | Normal-model answer vs resampling the actual data, "the gap between them is the size of the assumption" L2 p.80; simulated null band L4 p.27–28; plot the raw series L1 p.38; t is a fat-tailed normal L2 p.81. VaR, empirical VaR, kurtosis **[EXAM-DEFINED]** cells 20, 30 |

Runtime ≈ 3–4 minutes (measured on throwaway random matrices).

## Problem 3 — Cross-country asset return prediction (research project)

### 3.0 Design fixed before anything is fitted (cell 36 rule 2)

A markdown "Design fixed before fitting" cell plus one printed constants dict, placed **above** the benchmark cell. Deviations after that point go into a markdown list with what/why/effect.

| Item | Choice | Grounding |
|---|---|---|
| Sample | First target month **2003-01** (the 36-month trailing volatility first exists; every back-filled cell, last one 2002-08, is out of every design matrix) | data profile; cells 34, 37 |
| Initial training block | **2003-01 … 2010-12** (96 months, 4,800 rows; contains the GFC) | cell 36 rule 2; L4 p.43; L1 p.34 (nonstationarity) |
| Out-of-sample window | **2011-01 … 2024-12** (168 months, 8,400 rows), touched once; sub-periods 2011–17, 2018–24 | L4 p.43; L5 p.48–52 |
| Schemes | static (fit once at 2010-12); **expanding** (primary; fixed start, refit each December → 14 refits); rolling (96-month window) | L5 p.48–51 (step 12, as in L5 p.51); cell 37 |
| Tuning | Inside each training window only: three annual validation folds (fit on data up to year b−j, validate on year b−j+1, j = 3,2,1), mean fold MSE, ties → larger penalty, then refit on the whole window. Penalty parametrised as α/n so it means the same thing at every sample size. Chosen value must not sit at the grid edge (logged). | L5 p.48–52 (train → validation → test; alpha from validation only), p.35–36, p.27 & p.53 (grid edges), p.25 |
| Target | y = r_{i,t} / σ̂_{i,t−1}, σ̂ = 36-month SD of the asset's own past excess returns (ddof = 1), computed by us (avoids `x5`'s 0.004 floor) | cell 37 (recommended target); constant-variance assumption L3 p.2–3; var(b) ∝ σ² L2 p.71–73; "calm months and panics" L2 p.80 |
| Forecast benchmarks | Trailing mean of y through t−1, updated monthly (**pooled over assets = primary — see open question Q4**), per-class and per-asset versions always reported, and **zero**. Raw-return R² by class also reported against the literal per-asset trailing mean of raw returns. | cell 36; L4 p.45–46 ("why not out-of-sample Ȳ?"); L5 p.55–57 |
| Portfolio benchmarks | EW, risk parity (∝ 1/σ̂), TSMOM (∝ sign(12-month return)/σ̂); unit gross exposure; monthly rebalancing; computed and printed **before** any model | **[EXAM-DEFINED]** cell 36 rule 1 |
| Search size | The full list of specifications is fixed here (≈ 22 core + ≤ 5 pre-listed extras) and printed next to every headline, with the Bonferroni critical value computed in a cell | L4 p.25–28; L5 p.57 ("the size of the search belongs next to the number") |
| Expectations & power | Written down before computing (commit-before-compute); a short power calculation computed in a cell | L2 p.78; L4 p.26; var(X̄) = σ²/n L2 p.63 (flagged as our construction) |

### 3.1 Know your data (cell 37 step 1)

Integrity checks against the data profile. **Trap audit first:**
- 7 assets with leading back-filled `x2/x3/x5` → set to missing.
- `x10` is the **same-year average** of the monthly short rate stamped from January, so it looks up to 11 months ahead and a one-month lag does not fix it.
- `x11` stops early for countries 12, 9 and 11 at the 2021–23 inflation shock; rebuild it as `x86 − x12` and report the fit, pooled correlation 0.988.
- Six exact duplicate columns between the curated and extended files, and 26 hidden global columns in the extended file.
- `x1` is frozen for 5 currency-class assets in late 2024 (10 target rows).
- `asset_16`'s `x5` is floored at 0.004.

Then the full-sample return and predictor descriptives the exam lists:
- cumulative excess returns by class;
- a per-asset table of annualised mean, volatility, Sharpe and worst month;
- the correlation heat map ordered by class, with a 4 × 4 block table;
- rolling 12-month Sharpe by class and its year-to-year persistence;
- characteristic scale, distribution and persistence within class;
- identity checks: `x2` = the compounded past-12-month return and `x5` = the past-36-month SD.

**Tercile sorts are run on the training block only (2003–2010).** They relate predictors to future returns, so running them on 2011–2024 before the design is fixed would be snooping (L4 p.43; L5 p.41, p.58 #4). Hypotheses: `x1` carry, `x2` 12-month momentum, `x3` value / long-horizon reversal, `x4` 12-month change in the carry fundamental, `x5` 36-month volatility (the risk measure).

Grounding: L1 p.37–38, p.44 (`df.corr()` heat map); L1 p.35 (sorting as nonlinearity); L2 p.91 (t of a mean); L4 p.25–28 (Bonferroni for the 25 sort tests).

### 3.2 Feature engineering (cell 37 step 2)

| Block | Construction | Why / grounding |
|---|---|---|
| Lags | `x2`, `x5` as stored; `x1`, `x3`, `x4` shifted 1 month within asset; **every macro series shifted 2 months** (1-month minimum + release delay; 1 month as robustness); low-frequency annual/quarterly columns not used | cell 34; merge on publication date, not period end L5 p.58 #2 |
| Characteristics | **Within-class, within-month rank** of each lagged characteristic, scaled to [−0.5, 0.5] | Units differ by up to 3 orders of magnitude across classes; ranks are robust, bounded, parameter-free (cannot leak) and comparable for the penalty (L5 p.23; outliers L3 p.12–18). Within-class z-score as robustness (L7 p.23) |
| Characteristic levels (secondary spec) | Each asset's own lagged characteristic as a trailing 60-month z-score of its own history | Ranks can only rank assets within a class; this adds a time-series channel so Q2's "macro adds" test is not the only timing channel |
| Global macro `x6–x9` | log `x6`; trailing 60-month z-score (min 24 obs), then lag; enters with **class-specific slopes** | "Trailing information only" cell 37; interactions L3 p.53–54 |
| Country macro | 6 curated series: short rate `x86` (replaces the look-ahead `x10`), inflation `x12`, FX `x13`, log `x14`, log `x15`, `x16`. Each is taken as a **differential vs country 7**, then turned into a **trailing z-score per country** so that static country gaps (fixed effects) are removed and only time variation enters. Classes B, C, D get their own country's values × class. **Class A gets none** (no natural country, cell 34; parsimony L4 p.23) | cell 37 (country 7 the natural base; differentials); country fixed effects would otherwise pose as macro (verification finding) |
| `x11` | Diagnosed and rebuilt (`x86 − x12`, rebuild quality reported), **not added as a column**: it is an exact linear combination of two included series | cell 37; exact collinearity L3 p.40 |
| Extended file | Used only for the audit and for `x86`. Never screened against returns | multiple testing: "you will always find something" L4 p.25–28; screening then validating is cheating L5 p.41 |
| Class intercepts | Class dummies (A reference) **left unpenalised**; ridge/lasso penalise only the predictor slopes (implemented exactly by within-class demeaning — verified on synthetic data) | Ridge penalises slopes, not the intercept L5 p.12; class intercepts L3 p.50; dummy coding L3 p.45, p.51–52 |
| Outside data | None | search size; release-date documentation (cell 34) |

The notebook ends this section with the predictor table and counts, as cell 37 asks. Main sets:

| Set | Contents | Columns |
|---|---|---|
| M1 | class intercepts only | 3 |
| M2 | M1 + 5 characteristic ranks | 8 |
| M3 | M2 + global × class + country × class | 42 |

### 3.3 Models × evaluation schemes (cell 37 step 3)

- **Models:** OLS (unpenalised baseline and kitchen-sink warning, L4 p.47–48); **ridge, the primary** ("suitable when features are weak and should still contribute", L5 p.60; standardise inside the window, L5 p.23); lasso as a pre-listed extra (L5 p.17–24); random forest (300 trees, max_features = 1/3, minimum leaf 200, untuned — L8 p.43–45, p.55, p.61).
  - The lecture's out-of-the-box default is the tree ensemble (L8 p.61–62). Linear wins "when the signal really is weak and linear — which, in asset pricing, is more often than you would like". So the RF is run on the identical harness as the check.
  - The 200-row leaf is our low-signal choice, flagged as a departure from L8 p.44's "grown deep".
  - Not used: KNN regression (not taught; curse of dimensionality, L6 p.37), neural nets, boosting (off; tuning budget is a leakage risk, L8 p.55), elastic net (formula only, L5 p.11), and clustering (the class labels are known, L7 p.4).
- **Grid:**
  - M1-OLS;
  - {OLS, ridge, RF} × {M2, M3} × {static, expanding, rolling};
  - ridge-expanding on global-only and country-only macro;
  - per-class ridge on M2;
  - that is 22 core specifications.
- **Reported:**
  - R²_OOS = 1 − SSE_model / SSE_benchmark against the trailing mean(s) and zero (L5 p.55–57), model × scheme, by class, by sub-period, with in-sample R² next to it (L4 p.47–48);
  - uncertainty as a **month-resampling bootstrap SE** (each month keeps its whole cross-section) and estimate ± 2 SE (L2 p.80, p.85). The month is the unit because all assets share each month's shocks.
- **Which predictors carry the signal:** ridge coefficient paths over the 14 refits with sign stability (L5 p.22 style), and RF out-of-sample permutation importance per OOS year with `scoring='neg_mean_squared_error'` (L8 p.57).
- **Leak alarm:** any R²_OOS above ~2% triggers an audit before interpretation (monthly stock-level R²_OOS is about 0.3–0.5%, L5 p.57).

### 3.4 Macro, placebo, robustness

- **Macro vs no macro:** ridge M3 vs M2 under the same scheme, rows, folds and benchmark (refit without macro, as cell 37 asks), split into global vs country.
- **Placebo:**
  - every raw macro series is circularly shifted by s ∈ {36, 48, …, 120} months before any transform;
  - then the identical pipeline is run;
  - 8 shifts. Every placebo value used at an OOS date is a real past observation, because no shift above 130 is used. For s ≥ 72, the trailing-z window at early OOS dates reaches wrapped values; this affects normalisation only and is disclosed;
  - a persistence table shows how correlated each shifted series stays with the truth.
  - Macro is credited only if its gain beats **all 8** placebos and is positive against the bootstrap SE (null logic from L4 p.26–28).
- **Pre-listed extras (≤ 5):**
  - lasso M3;
  - macro lag 1 month;
  - within-class z-score instead of rank;
  - M2/M3 plus characteristic levels (the timing channel).
- **Evaluation-only cuts:** excluding March–May 2020, and excluding the frozen-`x1` rows.

### 3.5 From forecasts to portfolios (cell 37 step 4) [EXAM-DEFINED metrics; costs are OUR CHOICE]

- **P1 (primary):** w ∝ ŷ/σ̂, unit gross exposure, monthly rebalancing. If ŷ is constant it collapses to risk parity, so risk parity is the natural bar.
- **P3 (secondary):** within-class long–short, (ŷ − class mean)/σ̂.
- **Metrics:**
  - annualised mean, volatility, Sharpe (√12·mean/sd), max drawdown, worst month, turnover;
  - gross and net of costs;
  - cumulative-return and drawdown plots;
  - sub-periods.
- **Costs:** one proportional cost per unit of one-way turnover, headline 10 bp, grid {0, 5, 10, 25, 50} bp, plus the break-even cost. Costs are charged to the benchmarks too. Lectures do not cover costs; see Q5.
- **Exposure vs timing:**
  - regress net P1 on net EW, RP and TSMOM, and report α, β and R² (L2 p.94–97, L3 MLR);
  - hand test β = 1 against RP;
  - average correlation of P1's weights with RP's and TSMOM's;
  - maximum single-asset weight and `asset_16` share reported.

### 3.6 Leakage audit, runtime, write-up

- **Leakage audit:** a markdown table maps each of L5 p.58's five leakage questions and AIG §4(a)–(d) to the cell where its guard lives. The executable checks are:
  - date-order asserts in every fold;
  - `n_samples_seen_` equals the training rows;
  - 20 random lag spot checks;
  - the `x2`/`x5` identities;
  - one causality test: truncate the raw data after 2010-12, rebuild, and assert that features, σ̂, benchmarks and benchmark weights up to 2010-12 are unchanged;
  - identity tests: P1(ŷ ≡ 1) = RP.
- **Runtime:** about 8–12 minutes serial on a 4-core machine (timed on synthetic arrays). No process pool.
- **Write-up** (cell 38):
  - Introduction: the question; why it matters for cross-country allocation; what the literature leads us to expect (see Q6); a preview.
  - Data: treatment of every trap; summary statistics; plots.
  - Methodology: reproducible from this section alone.
  - Results: in question order.
  - Interpretation: strong vs fragile evidence, and what we tried that did not work (every row of the ledger).
  - Conclusion: a half-page a portfolio manager can read alone.

## Open questions for you (each has a default; "defaults are fine" is a valid answer)

1. **SEED:** what are the last four digits of your student ID? Every Problem 2 number depends on it. (Problem 3 uses its own `P3_SEED = 7034` so it never overwrites `SEED`.)
2. **2.1 commit-before-compute:** will you write your 2–3-sentence prediction yourself before I run any Problem 2 code? *Default: yes. I won't draft it, and I'll wait for it.*
3. **Problem 3 scope:**
   - (a) Core only: 22 specifications, 8 placebo runs, about 8 minutes of runtime.
   - (b) Core plus the ≤ 5 pre-listed extras, about 12 minutes.
   - (c) Something leaner still.

   *Default: (b).*
4. **Primary trailing-mean benchmark for the vol-scaled panel target:**
   - Pooled across assets. It is conservative (hardest to beat without the class premia), and it is what an intercept-only model refitted monthly would forecast.
   - Per asset, each asset's own history. This is closer to the HW5 single-series harness, but noisier and therefore easier to beat.

   All versions are reported either way. The question only decides which one the verdict is pinned to. *Default: pooled.*
5. **Transaction costs** (not taught): uniform 10 bp headline with a 0–50 bp grid and break-evens, or did your course or homework specify a number? *Default: 10 bp plus the grid.*
6. **Literature in the Introduction.** Cell 38 asks what the literature leads you to expect. The lectures give only Gu–Kelly–Xiu (L1 p.36) and the 0.3–0.5% R² benchmark (L5 p.57). May I also name canonical cross-asset papers (value/momentum "everywhere", carry, time-series momentum), clearly as background you would verify? *Default: lecture sources plus cell 33's own statement only.*
7. **Where the answers go:** fill in `Final_Autumn_2026-1.ipynb` in place (git keeps the blank original), or work in a copy? *Default: in place.*
